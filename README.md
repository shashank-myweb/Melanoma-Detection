1. Create a multi-classification model
2. Use prefetch dataset
3. 3. 2 or 3 convolv layers and then max pooling and fc layer
4. create 1D array as output of flattening layer
5. stochastic or Adam optimizer
6. categorical entropy loss by summation of P log P
7. Findings in terms of overfitting or underfitting
8. then use data augmentation like zoom, flip, rotate (atleat 2 to 3 by tf.keras.layers)
9. tf.keras.sequential([
layer.experimental.preprocessing().
random.flip
or random.rotation
or random.zoom



    ])
  from trainds get1 image and apply this keras to this image and then show the visualize outcome and show the graph and then explain for all the 9 different class
then do it for the model
11. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66570789/keras-experimental-randomflip-and-randomrotation-do-not-work-with-map
12. use dropout after convolv layers
13. for imbalance sanity check - take trainds and then do a count of images for all 9 different classes and explain the findings like img domination and minimum imaging sample
14. and write in finding
15. then install augmentor pip install augmentor
16. normalization in top layer like convolv layer
